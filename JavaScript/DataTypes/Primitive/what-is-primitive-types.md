# Primitive Types

Primitive types represent single values and have immutable characteristics. In JavaScript, there are six primitive types:

- **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.

- **Boolean**: Represents a true or false value.

- **Undefined**: Represents an uninitialized variable.

- **Null**: Represents the absence of a value or a non-existent value.

- **Symbol**: (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Represents a unique and immutable value used to identify object properties.

When you assign a primitive value to a variable, the variable holds a copy of the value.
