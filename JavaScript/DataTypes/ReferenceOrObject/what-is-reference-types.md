# Reference Types also known as Object Types

Reference types are more complex and can hold multiple values. They are created using constructors or literal notation. Some common reference types in JavaScript include:

- **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs (properties).

- **Array**: Represents an ordered collection of values, indexed by numbers.

- **Function**: A JavaScript function.

- **Date**: Represents a specific point in time.

- **RegExp**: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching.

When you assign a reference type to a variable, the variable actually holds a reference (address in memory) to the object, not the object itself.
