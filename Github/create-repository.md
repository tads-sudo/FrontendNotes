# Let's create a GitHub repository.

We're aware that GitHub also functions as a storage platform, hosting repositories to store code and its history.

Allow me to guide you through the step-by-step process of how I established this repository on GitHub.

1. Open your web browser, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), and sign in with you account.

2. On the left hand side, you'll find a green button labeled "New". Click on it.

3. Give your repository a name (e.g, "FrontendNotes")

4. Optionally, add a description.

5. Choose the visibility (public or private).

6. You can choose to initialize the repository with a README file (this is optional).

7. If you want to make your code open-source, you can choose a license GitHub provides several popular open-source licenses to choose from.

That's it! You've now successfully created a repository on GitHub.

Let's now proceed to [Clone the Repository](/Github/clone-the-repository.md)

OR

Go back to definition of [GitHub](/Github/what-is-github.md)
