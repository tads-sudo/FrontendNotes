# Removing files or folder both on local and remote repository

1.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to Your Local Repository**: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your local repository is stored.

3.  **Remove the File(s) or Folder**: Use the git rm command followed by the file or folder name to remove it from your local repository. For example, if you want to remove a file named `example.txt`, you would run:

    ```
    git rm example.txt
    ```

    If you want to remove a folder and all its contents, you can use the -r flag for recursive deletion:

    ```
    git rm -r folder_name
    ```

4.  **Commit the Changes**: After removing the file(s) or folder, you'll need to commit the changes using the following commands:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Removed file(s) or folder"
    ```

5.  **Push Changes to Remote Repository**: Finally, push the changes to your remote repository using:

    ```
    git push origin branch_name
    ```

    Replace `branch_name` with the name of the branch you're working on.

This will remove the file(s) or folder from both your local and remote repositories.
