# What is GitHub?

- Think of GitHub like a special website where lots of people team up to work on computer code. It's like a big playground where many people can help each other in making and enhancing software.
- GitHub also serves as storage by hosting repositories. A repository is like a folder that holds code and its history. It keeps track of changes, making collaboration easy.
