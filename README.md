# FrontendNotes
This is my note on front-end development, continuously evolving through collaborative learning with peers, insightful tutorials, informative blog posts, articles, and official documentation.

This repo would be private in the meantime because I'm just starting it from scratch, but my goal with this note is to become my reference just in case I forget a certain topic of front-end development technologies. Also, I would share this in public to allow people to correct my perspective on every certain topic that I will make.
